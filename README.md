# Resume_Screening_Automation

🤖 Resume Screening Automation – Internee.pk Internship Project
This project is part of my internship with Internee.pk, focusing on automating the process of screening resumes against a given job description using Python and natural language processing techniques.

🧠 Objective:
To simulate a simple resume ranking tool that reads multiple resumes and evaluates how well they match the role of an AI/ML Intern. The system uses keyword-based matching to calculate a match percentage for each candidate.

📄 Job Description Keywords:
The job role chosen was AI/ML Intern, and the following key skills were considered essential:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Machine Learning

Research & Experimentation

Data Preprocessing

⚙️ How It Works:
Reads resumes in .pdf or .txt format.

Extracts text using PyPDF2 or direct file read.

Converts text to lowercase and cleans it for processing.

Compares the content with job description keywords.

Calculates a match percentage for each resume.

Outputs a ranked list of resumes.

📁 Project Structure:
AbdulSallam_Resume.pdf – My actual resume.

resume_1.txt and resume_2.txt – Dummy resumes for comparison.

resume_screening_results.csv – Final results with match %.

Resume_Screening_Automation.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.

README.md – This documentation.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Python

Jupyter Notebook

PyPDF2

Pandas

This project demonstrates how basic automation and NLP can help HR professionals in early-stage candidate filtering. It also showcases how data processing can be applied to real-world recruitment tasks.
